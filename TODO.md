 # Resume Builder TODO
 
## Decisions Made
- **Data Format:** YAML for structured resume data (flexible, version controlled and readable)
- **Templates:** LaTeX via Jinja2 (professional output, programmable, easily read)
- **Project Management:** Obsidian with symlinked files (AI-accessible, cross-project)
- **Versioning:** Metadata in YAML + git for code versioning
- **Resume Directory:** Resumes reside in directory format (Git VC enabled)

## Questions/Research Needed
- What's the optimal application tracking granularity?
- Which job posting APIs have the best data quality and availability?
- How will AI integrate with version controlled resumes provide helpful feedback?
